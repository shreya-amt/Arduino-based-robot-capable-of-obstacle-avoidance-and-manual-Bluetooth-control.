# arduino-based-robot-obstacle-avoidance-and-manual-bluetooth-control

This is an Arduino-based robot that can:
- Automatically avoid obstacles using ultrasonic sensors
- Be manually controlled using a Bluetooth-enabled smartphone

## 🚀 Features
- Obstacle detection and automatic steering
- Manual control via Bluetooth commands (e.g., forward, left, right, stop)
- Easy to build with Arduino UNO, HC-05, L298N, and ultrasonic sensor

## 🔧 Hardware Used
- Arduino UNO
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Bluetooth Module (HC-05)
- Motor Driver Module (L298N)
- DC Motors and Chassis
- Power Supply (Battery)
- Jumper Wires

## 📱 Manual Control
Use any Bluetooth terminal app (like "Serial Bluetooth Terminal") and send:
- `F` for Forward
- `B` for Backward
- `L` for Left
- `R` for Right
- `S` for Stop

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Upload the Arduino code to your board.
2. Connect components as shown in the circuit diagram.
3. Pair your phone with HC-05 and send control commands.
